  The parameter of the configurations are explained as follows:
  file number: the number of files the source server supplies.
  times: How many times the total content store capacity is as large as the total size of the files.
  height: the height of the tree.
  spread factor: the spread factor of the tree. Originally we plan to test the performance of the routing schemes on trees having spread factors of greater than 2. But at last we found that when the spread factor is greater than 2, the tree is so large that it is not easy to conduct simulations upon them.
