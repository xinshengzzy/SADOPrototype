  The parameter of the configurations are explained as follows:
  file number: the number of files the source server supplies.
  times: How many times the total content store capacity is as large as the total size of the files.
  height: the height of the heavy edge tree, including the upper tree and the clients connected to a client delegate router.
  upper spread factor: the spread factor of the upper tree. Originally we plan to test the performance of the routing schemes on trees whose upper part has a spread factor of more than 2. But at last we found that when the spread factor of the upper part is greater than 2, the tree is so large that it is not easy to conduct simulations upon them. 
  lower spread factor: the number of clients connected to each client delegate.
