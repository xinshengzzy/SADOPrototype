  In the set of experiments, the topology of the network is a tree. The tree is composed of two separate parts. The upper part is a binary tree of 7 levels. The to each leaf node of the binary tree, some more nodes are attached. In our experiments, the number of nodes attached to each leaf node of the upper part is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively. We call such a topology a heavy edge tree, and the number of nodes attached to each leaf node of the upper binary tree is called the edge spread factor of the tree. Togather with the case where the topology of the network is a binary tree of 8 levels, we test the performance of SADO on the heavy edge tree where the edge spread factor changes from 2 to 7. In all these experiments, there are 800 files in the network, and total content store capacity is 4 times over the total size of files in the network. The detailed configuration is recorded in the file experiment_configuration.dt.
