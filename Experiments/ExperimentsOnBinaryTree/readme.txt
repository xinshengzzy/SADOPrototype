  In the set of experiments, we test the performance of the our routing scheme, SADO, against another three routing schemes on the binary tree topology. The basic experiment setting is as following.
  The topology of the network is a binary tree of 8 levels. There are 800 files in the network. The total content store capacity is 4 times over the total size of files in the network. Then we tune the three parameters, i.e., the height of the tree, the number of the files in the network, and the times the total content store capacity is over the total size of the files in the network. The number of files in the network is 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, respectively. The height of the tree is 6 levels, 7 levels, 8 levels, 9 levels, 10 levels and ll levels, respectively. The times that the total content store capacity is over the total size of files in the network is 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Please refer experiment_configuration.dt for the detailed configuration of the experiments.
  At first, we hope to test the performance of the routing schemes in the topologies of k-ary trees. However, we found that the experiment where the topology is a 4-ary tree of 8 levels is unscalable. Imagine that there are 1465 nodes in a 4-ary tree of 8 levels.
